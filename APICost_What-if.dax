// Use case: You deliver an API service and want to invoice customers based on packages of 100.000 API calls.
// You want to round up to the next 100.000 calls to sell "packages"
// You also want a slider to adjust the price to see what you should charge

// You have a table with API calls per customer called APIUsage with coloms "Customer" and "Calls". 
// Then you want a calculated colomn like this
API Packages = 
(ROUNDUP(('APIUsageTable'[Calls] / 1000000),0))

// Then you want to create the What-if values, you can do that by GUI or create a calculated colomn like this
Euro = GENERATESERIES(5, 100, 5)

// ...and a measure like this
Euro Value = SELECTEDVALUE('Euro'[Euro], 50)

// Lastly you want a measure like this
API Calls Cost = SUM(APIUsageTable[API Packages]) * Euro[Euro Value]
