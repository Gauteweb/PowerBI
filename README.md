# PowerBI
Here you may find useful (_to me at least_) Power Query M and DAX scripts that I've created or forked. 

You will also find PBIX example files.

I mostly use Power BI together with data sources like Azure Monitoring (KQL queries), Cosmos DB and different API's developed by my great colleagues at [SuperOffice](https://github.com/SuperOffice), but also just for fun in my spare time.
